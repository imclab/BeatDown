BREAK BEAT (working title)
UCLA Gamelab

A slapstick-violence procedural music game for 2 players

=====================================
	USAGE
=====================================

There are 2 components:
A python program
A pure data patch


You need to run the patch 'pd_patches/poly_simp.pd' in pure data.
You then need to run SynthController.py with python

The python module handles game logic, and sends message over the local network (using pdsend, see SETUP) to control the puredata synthesizer patch.

Eventually there will a script that runs everything for you

=====================================
	SETUP
=====================================

* <Install RPi.GPIO, other stuff?>:

* Install Pure Data:
	
	add following line to /etc/apt/sources.list

	$ sudo apt-get update

	$ wget https://puredata.info/downloads/pd-extended-0-43-3-on-raspberry-pi-raspbian-wheezy-armhf/releases/1.0/Pd-0.43.3-extended-20121004.deb
